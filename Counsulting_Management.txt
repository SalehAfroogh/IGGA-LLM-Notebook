81. About half of McKinsey staff allowed to use generative AI: report

Employees of global consulting firm McKinsey and Company have been given permission to use generative artificial intelligence (AI), including ChatGPT, in the workplace, according to a report.

"About half of [our employees] are using those services with McKinsey's permission," said Ben Ellencweig, senior partner and global leader of McKinsey's AI consulting arm QuantumBlack, according to Venture Beat.

The organization has more than 30,000 employees across 67 countries. Ellencweig, however, clarified that the firm has rolled out guidelines and principles of generative AI use, which includes a prohibition on uploading confidential information.

Embracing AI in workplaces

The revelation adds McKinsey to the list of employers around the world embracing generative AI and the assistance they offer to workplaces. Recently, Japan-based firm Daiwa Securities Group also allowed around 9,000 employees to use ChatGPT in workplaces to ease the burden imposed by routine tasks.

The reports come amid growing acceptance of generative AI among employees across the world. In fact, findings from automatica revealed that employees in the United States (63%), Japan (76%), and China (87%) want ChatGPT to help them in workplace decision-making. 

In McKinsey's case, they did not disclose what they use generative AI for, but they noted that their tech staff "have them all in a sandbox, [and are] playing with them every day," reported Venture Beat.

Using AI safely

Alex Singla, another senior partner and global leader at QuantumBlack, unveiled a five-step approach on how to integrate generative AI in workplaces safely. As reported by Venture Beat, these suggestions include:

IT stack and infrastructure: Think about IT stack and infrastructure and where the AI tools and data will be located

Data: Determine whether to use structured or unstructured data, how to organise them, and what protections they require

Choose the right AI model

UI and UX: Consider the user interface and user experience of the AI to be used

Change management: Ensure those using AI will be supported, including how their work duties will be changed

The recommendations come as employers around the world get warnings on how generative AI can impact workplaces. For some employers, including Samsung, Amazon, Verizon, among others, they have implemented restrictions on using AI to stamp out potential privacy risks.

84. Responsible ai

Responsible AI

Trend 16: AI security emerges as the bedrock of enterprise resilience

Responsible AI is not only an ethical imperative but also a strategic advantage for companies looking to thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world. Rules and regulations balance the benefits and risks of AI. They guide responsible AI development and deployment for a safer, fairer, and ethical AI ecosystem.

Staying informed about associated compliance requirements is vital for organizations and individuals, especially amid industry lawsuits related to generative AI. Novelist John Grisham has taken OpenAI to court, and programmers allege Codex crawl their work but don't treat attribution, copyright notices, and license terms as legally essential. Meanwhile, visual artists have targeted Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt for copyright infringement. Regulations to significantly impact the industry's trajectory, shaping growth, innovation, market entry, and ethical practices. Businesses must proactively respond to evolving AI regulations, incorporating them into a strategy for compliance, trust, and long-term success.

AI's dual role presents a dichotomy: it can automate hacking, sidestepping traditional security, yet simultaneously bolster security through anomaly detection, threat prediction, and real-time monitoring. This interplay necessitates continuous adaptation to stay ahead of risks. AI security is vital for the integrity of applications across domains, shaping the industry's future by addressing critical concerns like data privacy, integrity, and fairness.

Businesses should approach AI security with a multifaceted strategy by implementing robust security measures, regularly updating AI models, conducting risk assessments, educating employees, using AI-based security tools, addressing ethical considerations, and collaborating with experts. Businesses can also leverage AI-driven security tools for advanced threat detection, anomaly detection, and real-time monitoring, augmenting their overall security posture. Lastly, collaborating with AI security experts and staying updated on emerging threats and best practices is essential for proactive adaptation to the dynamic security landscape. These comprehensive measures collectively fortify AI security, instilling trust and resilience in AI initiatives while safeguarding systems and sensitive data.



85.  ChatGPT a game changer for artificial intelligence

ChatGPT is the topic on everyone's lips. What can it do? How does it do it? And is my job safe? We take a closer look at this revolutionary generative artificial intelligence and analyze what it can (and cannot) do. In particular, we focus on its impact on business and ability to transform a wide range of activities along your value chain. Given its significant capabilities, top managers would be ill advised to bury their heads in the sand. Generative AI needs to be addressed – so you can harness its potential for your business.



The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 caused something of a storm. Just three months later, the website was enjoying around one billion visits a month and 25 million visitors a day. These shockwaves are still being widely felt across the business world.

ChatGPT is perhaps the best of the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots released to date. It quickly went viral because of its unique characteristics, especially its human-like, intuitive answers, its knowledge and its versatility. Of course, it still demonstrates certain limitations, such as the information it draws on not being completely up-to-date and its poor tracking of sources. But the race is now on to overcome these deficiencies, and the true potential of what ChatGPT can do remains unknown.

ChatGPT is an example of generative AI, which uses deep-learning algorithms to create novel content, ranging from text and images to music and 3D models. This technology has made rapid progress in recent years.

Not only does generative AI offer clear benefits across the entire value chain, it also has the potential to disrupt a wide range of sectors – including the tech industry. Top managers must address its potential as a matter of urgency or face the dire consequences of being left behind by their competitors.

A wide range of use cases

Apart from creating content, design, music and the like, ChatGPT can have a great impact on automating tasks and reducing costs for companies. It is particularly useful in areas such as data analysis, pattern recognition and predictions, leading to improved decision-making and problem-solving.

In manufacturing, for example, generative AI has automation and efficiency potential along the entire value chain. It can transform trend detection and data analysis, as well as information retrieval and translation to improve R&D. In production planning it can help with inventory management, resource allocation and capacity planning. At the other end of the value chain, in aftersales service, it can transform referrals, automation maintenance and service requests. The extent of its impact in each of these areas varies, as shown in the illustration below, depending on the area's potential for automation. But its transformative power is unquestionable.

An enterprise-grade implementation of ChatGPT, a natural language interface to our data warehouse and an automated generator of logic trees. These are just some of the ways Nous Group is using generative AI to support its consulting work with clients around the world.

Over the past year, expert consultants from across our international network have been exploring the capabilities of AI (artificial intelligence) to understand how it can improve productivity and drive better outcomes for our clients, their communities and our consultant teams.

Nous Principal Rob Ewin, lead of our AI working group, said: “AI brings exciting opportunities to reexamine our approach to a growing array of processes. It has the potential to free up our clients and our people so they can spend more time and energy on higher-order problem solving that delivers better outcomes and bigger impact.

“Across sectors, there’s great enthusiasm to unearth and harness AI’s value. This is exciting but it must be supported by systems that safeguard the accuracy of output and the security of information.”

Creating the right conditions for innovation and development

Our enterprise-grade implementation of ChatGPT, known as NousGPT, runs on customised Microsoft technologies and operates as a closed loop system, enabling our teams to safely experiment and develop their skills in AI.

Nous Principal Sophie O’Connor, our Project Excellence lead, said: “In building NousGPT, we’ve created a safe environment for our consultants and corporate teams to develop their confidence while getting a practical understanding of how AI can deliver greater value.

“Investing in our people and our capabilities is a key focus at Nous. AI is moving fast – how we adopt and adapt now will set us up for bigger success down the track.”

Going beyond the chat interface

Nous’ experimentation with generative AI has included prototyping two internal productivity tools, known as DawnGPT and Diana.

Nous Principal David Diviny, our Chief Data Scientist, said: “Generative AI can be so much more than chat bots. Thinking beyond a chat interface has the potential to scale the productivity impact of generative AI.

“This requires a deep understanding of a user’s tasks and how generative AI can overcome limiters to the ideal experience of that task.”

Our first productivity tool is DawnGPT, a natural language interface to the Data Assets Warehouse at Nous (DAWN), which brings together proprietary data and public information to facilitate rapid analysis. DAWN includes data on topics including population, human services, economic indicators, tertiary education and job advertisements.

DawnGPT provides an intuitive interface that seamlessly translates natural language into structured query language (SQL), providing consultants with a means to access data and an avenue to hone their SQL skills. The data results can then be visualised interactively or as a PowerPoint and a narrative can be generated to complement the results.

DawnGPT seamlessly translates natural language into structured query language.

Our second productivity tool, Diana, generates logic trees for structured problem solving that breaks down a question or problem into its constituent parts. It is essentially a visual representation of structured thinking, with each branch representing a subset or component of the main question.

David said: “Diana uses generative AI to give our consulting teams a head start on projects. It is not the end solution, but the beginning of a creative problem-solving process.

“The possibilities for applications like these are endless and it’s an exciting journey to be on.”

All use of AI at Nous is guided by clear principles to ensure its use is safe, secure and generates genuine value that enables our teams to push the thinking even further and deliver higher quality work for our clients.
