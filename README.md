# <strong>Generative AI and LLMs in Industry: A text- mining Analysis and Critical Evaluation of Guidelines and Policy Statements Across Fourteen Industrial Sectors</strong>
 
The <strong>IGGA Text Analysis Project</strong> is a comprehensive analysis framework designed to process and analyze textual data across diverse industries. Using <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> and advanced visualization techniques, this project extracts meaningful insights from industry-specific text documents.  

Key features include:  
- <strong>Frequency Analysis</strong> to identify the most prominent keywords.  
- <strong>TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity</strong> for cross-industry textual comparison.  
- <strong>Sector-Specific Keyword Matching</strong> to assess domain-specific terminologies.  
- <strong>Sankey Diagrams</strong> for visualizing word relationships and keyword distributions.

<strong>Objectives</strong>  
This project aims to:  
1. Analyze industry-specific textual data to extract dominant keywords and trends.  
2. Compare textual content across industries using <strong>cosine similarity</strong> and <strong>TF-IDF</strong>.  
3. Visualize keyword frequencies and relationships using bar charts and Sankey diagrams.  
4. Provide a replicable NLP pipeline for industry-focused text analysis.  

---

<strong>Project Workflow</strong>  
The project consists of the following steps:

1. <strong>Data Preparation</strong>  
   - Word documents (`.docx`) are processed into plain text files (`.txt`) using `docx2txt`.

2. <strong>Text Processing</strong>  
   - Text cleaning: Removal of symbols, numbers, and stopwords.  
   - Tokenization: Splitting text into meaningful words.  
   - Lemmatization: Converting words to their base forms.

3. <strong>Frequency Analysis</strong>  
   - Identify and visualize the <strong>top 20 keywords</strong> for each industry.

4. <strong>Sector Keyword Matching</strong>  
   - Match keywords against predefined <strong>industry-specific keyword lists</strong> to highlight key terminologies.

5. <strong>Cosine Similarity and Heatmap</strong>  
   - Use <strong>TF-IDF Vectorization</strong> to compute cosine similarity between industry texts.  
   - Visualize similarity scores as a heatmap.

6. <strong>Sankey Diagram Visualization</strong>  
   - Display relationships between industries, top words, and domain-specific keywords.

<strong>How to Run the Project</strong>  
1. **Clone this repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SalehAfroogh/IGGA-LLM-Notebook.git
   cd IGGA-LLM-Notebook
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn docx2txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open IGGA Text Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
Execute all cells to generate visualizations and analysis results.
Optional: If the NLTK stopwords list isn't available, download it in Python:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
<strong>Outputs</strong>

Bar Charts: Top 20 keywords for each industry.
Cosine Similarity Heatmap: Quantifies textual similarity between industries.
Sankey Diagrams: Visualizes relationships between industries, top keywords, and implementation keywords.
<strong>Use Cases</strong>
This project can be applied to:

Industry-Specific Text Analysis: Identifying trends and key terminologies across sectors.
Content Comparison: Evaluating the textual similarity between industry documents.
Visualizing Insights: Producing intuitive charts and diagrams for data-driven decision-making.
NLP Pipelines: Replicating or extending the methodology for other text analysis projects.
