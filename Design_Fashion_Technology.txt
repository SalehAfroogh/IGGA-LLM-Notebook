As consumer behavior and technology continue to evolve, Nike is poised to further its AI capabilities. Plans likely include the expansion of AI in customer service applications, increased automation in the supply chain, and deeper collaborations with tech partners like Cognizant. Given its past performance and strategic focus, Nike’s AI initiatives will undoubtedly continue to play a significant role in shaping both the company and the broader retail industry.

Conclusion

Nike’s journey in AI represents a well-rounded strategy that touches multiple facets of the business, from customer experience to supply chain and IT operations. By focusing on delivering personalized experiences, optimizing operations, and tackling challenges head-on, Nike serves as a textbook example of how AI can be effectively implemented in a large, global enterprise. Its efforts in AI have not only improved its bottom line but have also set the stage for future innovations that will likely continue to redefine the retail landscape.



92. Ralph Lauren testing AI

Ralph Lauren is leveraging early learnings from existing artificial intelligence use cases to test generative AI across a range of business functions, company leaders shared. 

The apparel manufacturer and retailer is already using AI and machine learning in inventory optimization, forecasting, and consumer engagement, and it will test use of generative AI for such use cases as copy editing, graphics, and computer programming, CFO and COO Jane Nielsen said in an earnings call with investors, according to a transcript.  

The strategy aligns with efforts by other companies in the industry that are similarly exploring the use of the fast-moving technology. The experimental nature also dovetails with other pilots by Ralph Lauren during its most recent quarter, including launching its first NFTs in partnership with the Poolsuite platform and its Web3 community,

Ralph Lauren, which is leaning into the luxury market as part of its longtime growth plans, added 1 million new consumers to its direct-to-consumer business during the fourth quarter, to reach a total of 5 million new DTC consumers this fiscal year. It also reached 52 million social media followers globally.

“Our direction of travel from a strategic standpoint is to pivot the company further into DTC,” said CEO Patrice Louvet. “Our DTC today is about 63%, 64% of [revenue] for the total company. And as we guided during Investor Day [in September 2022], we expect the numbers to be north of that in the coming years.” 

Sales for Ralph Lauren’s digital ecosystem. which includes directly operated sites, pure-play, department store dot-coms, and social commerce, increased high-single digits during the year. Owned digital sites alone saw sales grow mid-single digits, and the company has put user experience enhancements through digital content and more customer personalization on its roadmap for the upcoming fiscal year.

Though Q4 revenue grew 2% in North America, retail comp-store sales dipped 4%. Physical retail remains a core component of its bid to drive connected commerce, and Ralph Lauren welcomed 21 new stores and concession-based shop-in-shops around the world in Q4. This included a particular emphasis in China, which the company expects to remain one of its fastest-growing markets. 

The company, which has closed two-thirds of its wholesale doors in North America over the last three to four years, plans to open 250 stores over the next three years. 



93. AI designer creating fashion grails from iconic runways

Though their eyes have a holographic quality and their flesh appears to have been oxygen-starved, there’s an uncanny magnetism to the models that Field Skjellerup works with. The fashion archivist has been experimenting with AI for the best part of two years, feeding images of vintage Japanese fashions through a GAN model – a recent innovation in machine learning – to eerie and convincing effect. He’s created sculptural puffers with slashed waistbands, metallic concertina skirts, and avant-garde parkas festooned in artfully-arranged piles of rubbish. Prompted by images of Junya Watanabe AW04, Hussein Chalayan’s AW00, and Kosuke Tsumura’s Final Home project, the images look as though they’ve been pilfered from some kind of cybernetic mind bank. 

“I’ve spent the majority of my adult life working dead-end jobs for minimum wage and I have little to no relationship with any educational institution,” he says. “But this is such a powerful tool. I’ve managed to create the blueprint for the most hyped pair of sneakers in the world, and I think that’s really saying something.” Skjellerup’s referring to a series of Nike shoes that he showcased on Instagram last week, which look almost exactly like the kind of thing Simone Rocha would design, surfaced in laser-cut mesh, rubberised petals, and ribboned laces. Far from the haunted DALL-E renderings that have been popularised online – all scorched edges and Francis Bacon wails – Skjellerup’s creations manage to look real. “People think they’re physical products and have asked me how to purchase them. I’m just waiting on the call from Nike!”

As exciting as this may be for STEM enthusiasts, the advancements made in AI fashion often give way to real-life anxieties. If a machine can learn the handwriting of a brand and outpace its atelier, what’s to say that designers won’t be rendered obsolete? “I feel like people’s fears are warranted but the idea that artists will be eradicated is a little far-fetched,” Skjellerup says. “There will be job losses but I think new movements will arise from automation, people will put an onus on ‘human-made’ products. Am I setting an example for this kind of thing? I’m not sure I have an answer for that yet.” If creativity was once understood to be a uniquely human accomplishment, then AI has also inherited its prejudices – regurgitating images of rakish models with the spindly legs of a vaudevillian puppet. The algorithm can make our lives easier, but it’s often as flawed as we are.

Ultimately, humans choose how these systems are made and what data they are exposed to – and the consequences can often be severe. In January 2020, Robert Williams, a Black man in Detroit, was arrested for a crime he did not commit because of an incorrect facial-recognition match. AI (much like the cameras they have been trained by) are rubbish at recognising people with darker skin tones, which is a standard that dates back to when film cameras were optimised to capture the faces of light-skinned people. “I’d admit this has been the trend with the majority of my published imagery to date,” Skjellerup says. “Given the racial bias in these pre-trained models, it’s easy to fall back on whiteness as the default. My hope is that the companies creating them will change but I’d personally like to make improvements in producing imagery that includes all kinds of people.”

For Skjellerup, who also runs an impressive sales platform of archival Comme des Garçons, Issey Miyake, and Yoshiki Hishnuma (amongst hundreds of other grails) AI is first and foremost a research tool. Albeit somewhat fictional, his work has the potential to breathe new meaning into some of fashion’s most seminal collections – locked into a constant process of sampling and recontextualising. It means that even the most legendary designers will be able to live forever – their body of work absorbed and reproduced by the algorithm. “The development of AI tools will mark the biggest change in all mediums of art for the next 100 years,” he says. “Integration will be fraught with ethical and legal discussions and radical new ways of art making. Not only will people use these systems to play into pre-existing processes but new modes of expression will also be created.”



94.  AI and change in management

Shiseido, the 140 year-old Japanese cosmetics business, is using innovation and technology to drive gradual transformation across all of its 26 brands to prepare them for the future.

“The company realised that the traditional way of working wasn’t sustainable any more,” Alessio Rossi, the company’s New York-based global chief digital officer, told an audience at the recent dmexco conference.

“So they had to shift gears and promote change across the organisation, not just in digital, but innovation can come from the supply chain or anywhere.” (For more details, read WARC’s report: Change management at scale: how Shiseido is using data and AI.)

Internal initiatives include the Shiseido Digital Centre of Excellence, launched last year to oversee change management related to all things digital and to prioritise areas of focus, and SHISEIDO+, a digital academy enabling staff to learn how to integrate new technology into what they do.

“Shiseido has the objective to become a leading company in consumer intimacy in the beauty industry, which is really powered by data,” Rossi explained.

“We think if we know more about them, we have to talk less, we have to interrupt less, we can interject in consumers’ lives in a way that is relevant.”

Artificial intelligence is playing a vital role in this, by making sense of the huge volumes of data the company and its brands have access to.

A project involving IBM Watson’s artificial intelligence tool Lucy, for example, is helping marketing staff understand the data by asking Lucy questions, framed in natural, conversational language and getting answers to things like the correlation between investment in social media spending and growth in market share.

Rossi acknowledge that staff could be fearful of the implications of AI for their own jobs but offered reassurance.

“AI at Shiseido isn’t replacing anybody, it’s helping people and actually creating jobs because training Lucy to understand beauty is not an easy exercise.

“We’re creating a new class of professionals that didn’t exist before.”

99.  How Cotton On Is Taking the Aussie Aesthetic Global with AI

How Cotton On Is Taking the Aussie Aesthetic Global with AI

Is content creation slowing you down? Let’s pick up the pace. Learn how Aussie brand Cotton On is using visual AI to save time and make smarter decisions, faster.

Discover how Cotton On uses Dash Hudson to:

Use AI to create high-performing photos in real-time to effectively increase engagement.

Leverage data-backed insights to select content to re-post and which Australian influencers to showcase and collaborate with.

Craft strategic campaigns across the brand’s most important marketing channels

Revolutionizing Content Creation


Cotton On knows its laid-back Aussie style is best showcased on the ultimate visual marketing channel, Instagram. The missing piece? Data to back the social team’s creative process. In the especially crowded space of apparel on social media, the Aussie brand needed its content to stand out amongst a sea of competitors and to create imagery faster to scale effectively. To do so, Cotton On uses Dash Hudson’s AI technology to build a data-driven content strategy. Yes, it’s possible—and powerful in today’s saturated social world.

"We’ve seen a big increase in engagement using Dash Hudson. The user interface makes it so easy to judge why you had a great week, and how you can repeat that success. It also reveals what those moments were that lead you to such an incredible engagement rate. It makes it so easy to take the learnings and put them into action."

Mariah Fox,
Former Global Social Media Manager at Cotton On

Predicting Content Performance

‍

Dash Hudson’s visual intelligence technology, Vision, collects and analyzes all of a brand’s photos from social and from within its own content management system. Vision is then able to see what items, colors and visual elements are actually inside an image — not unlike how the human eye sees a photo. It then determines, based on a brand’s recent performance, what types of photos its consumers care about most. This means that brands can know if a photo — be it a product shot or fresh from a photo shoot — will perform before it’s posted or used in a campaign.

‍

"Vision is changing the way we do things in head office. We now say that if Vision says it’s not going to perform highly, we’re not posting it."

Mariah Fox,
Former Global Social Media Manager at Cotton On

‍

Create Better Content in Real Time

‍

The accuracy of Vision’s predictions for Cotton On have been so on point, that the social team uses the visual cues to guide the creative team in their creation of new content. Each time the brand shoots a campaign, the team uploads the images into Dash Hudson to see Vision predictions in real time. In this way, the team can make adjustments to their shooting style to align with the tastes of their audience on social. Before implementing Vision feedback, about 15% of the images Cotton On posted from campaign shoots performed above the brand’s average engagement rate. After bringing the technology on set, 70–90% of photos created were above average performers. This means the team saved time and money on set, while curating a trove of high quality content to use on Instagram.

‍

"We ran all of our assets through Vision, and saw that it really rated influencer visuals higher. While this is something we felt to be true, when the data clearly tells you something, you can’t argue with it."

Mariah Fox,
Former Global Social Media Manager at Cotton On

‍

The (New) Cotton On Way 

‍

Embracing new technology has enabled the team at Cotton On to take a data-driven approach to their creative and drive performance across channels. They’re now able to better engage their audience by serving them up more of what they love. Multiple teams at Cotton On are now using Dash Hudson to create their own channel strategies, and the social team has become a hub for brand assets and innovation within the organization.

What We Can Learn From Cotton On's Strategy



Embracing the Role of AI in Content Performance

Cotton On's challenge was to stand out among the immense volume of content on Instagram. They wanted to ensure their images not only looked great but also resonated with their audience. Vision thorough analysis and performance prediction helps the brand do that.



Influencer Content and Earned Media Strategy

Vision also aids Cotton On in selecting influencer imagery that aligns with their audience's preferences, ensuring that their owned, earned and influencer content consistently engages their audience. The technology has become integral to Cotton On's social media strategy, influencing decisions on what content to post.



Extending AI Insights Beyond Social Media

The insights Cotton On has gained from Vision have spilled over into other marketing areas, like email campaigns. The brand now predominantly uses Vision-approved influencer images in their email marketing, leading to higher click-throughs and conversions.



100.  South Africa to adopt AI

Artificial Intelligence adoption in South Africa is considered low, as experts suggest that large organisations are not AI-ready. However, there is little evidence to prove these sentiments. The research explained the current AI adoption criteria of four large organisations in South Africa from different industries and compared the differences. This explanatory study followed an interpretive philosophy with an inductive approach to explain the AI adoption process of organisations through semi-structured interviews. The findings revealed that organisations are AI-ready, and the low adoption is mainly because AI use cases have not been evident. Organisations view AI as a tool to enable the business to solve business problems and in return create business value. The findings provide an explanation of the decision criteria used by large South African organisations for adopting AI.
